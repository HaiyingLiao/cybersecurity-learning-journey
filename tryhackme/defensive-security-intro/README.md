# 🛡️ TryHackMe — [Defensive Security Intro](https://tryhackme.com/room/defensivesecurityintro)

This room introduces the fundamentals of **defensive security**, also known as **blue teaming**. It explains how organisations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats, and provides hands-on practice investigating alerts in a simulated SOC environment.

## Concepts I Learned

### 1. What Defensive Security Is

Defensive security focuses on **protecting** an organisation’s systems, networks, and data from attacks.  
It is the counterpart to offensive security, and its goal is to **prevent**, **detect**, and **respond** to threats.

### 2. The Cost of Poor Security

Weak or incomplete security controls can:

- Expose sensitive data
- Disrupt business operations
- Lead to severe financial losses
- Damage an organisation’s reputation

Strong defensive security is essential for business continuity.

## Key Areas of Defensive Security

### 1. **Monitoring & Detecting**

Watching for unusual or malicious activity using tools like SIEM, IDS, and logs.

### 2. **Incident Response**

Taking quick, structured action when a threat is detected to contain damage.

### 3. **Threat Intelligence**

Understanding attacker behaviour, tactics, and patterns to predict and defend against threats.

### 4. **Vulnerability Management**

Identifying and fixing weaknesses before attackers exploit them.

### 5. **Investigation & Analysis**

Reviewing alerts, logs, and evidence to determine what happened and how to respond.

These areas make up the core responsibilities of a blue-team analyst.

# Defence in Depth

Organisations do not rely on one tool or control. They build **layers of defence** so that if one fails, others still protect the organisation.

Examples:

- **Employee Training** (reduces human error)
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- **Firewalls**
- **Security Policies**

This layered approach ensures that even if an employee clicks a malicious link, other controls help prevent damage.

# Exploring the Security Operations Centre (SOC)

A **SOC** is the central hub for defensive security.  
It operates 24/7 and employs analysts who:

- Review security alerts
- Investigate anomalies
- Escalate or respond to incidents
- Monitor systems, networks, and logs

SOC analysts are the **eyes and ears** of an organisation’s defence.

# Practical Skills I Learned

In the FakeBank simulation, I worked as part of their defensive security team using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform.

I learned how to:

- Review and interpret security alerts
- Identify suspicious vs. normal system activity
- Analyse SIEM event details
- Understand what different alert types mean
- Follow a logical process to investigate flagged events

This exercise provided a realistic introduction to how SOC analysts review incidents in real organisations.

# Skills Gained

- Understanding the purpose and scope of defensive security (blue teaming)
- Awareness of major defensive domains (monitoring, IR, threat intel, vuln management, investigation)
- Recognising the value of defence-in-depth
- Understanding what a SOC is and what SOC analysts do
- Beginner-level familiarity with viewing alerts inside a SIEM environment
