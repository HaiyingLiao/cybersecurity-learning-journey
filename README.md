# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

A continuous journal documenting my hands-on practice, lab work, and progress toward becoming a cybersecurity professional.

## Overview

This repository tracks everything I learn as I progress through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, TryHackMe, and my own mini-projects.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in security principles, develop practical skills, and create a transparent, authentic learning record.
