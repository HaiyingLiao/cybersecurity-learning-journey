# 🎓 Google Cybersecurity Certificate — The History of Cybersecurity

This module explores how early cyber attacks shaped today’s security industry, how threat actor techniques evolved over time, and why modern cybersecurity practices exist. It connects historical attacks to the frameworks, teams, and defensive strategies used today.

## What I learned

### Many modern attacks come from old ideas

Threat actors often **reuse**, **modify**, or **enhance** older attack techniques. Malware, phishing, and social-engineering methods seen today have roots in early cyber incidents.

### Early attacks revealed huge security gaps

Incidents like the **Brain virus** and **Morris worm** showed how quickly malware could spread — even with limited technology — and forced organisations to create formal security processes.

### Human behaviour remains the biggest target

Social engineering (e.g., phishing, vishing, smishing) continues to be one of the most effective attack methods because people are naturally trusting or easily influenced.

### Major breaches like Equifax highlight the cost of poor security

The Equifax breach (2017) demonstrated that ignoring known vulnerabilities can result in massive financial, legal, and ethical consequences.

# Notable Historical Attacks

## Brain Virus (1986)

- Created to prevent pirated software use, but spread unintentionally.
- Infected computers via floppy disks and travelled globally in months.

## Morris Worm (1988)

- Designed to measure internet size; instead crashed thousands of systems.
- Spread by repeatedly installing itself due to poor logic.
- Affected ~10% of the internet — millions in damages.
- Lesson: led to the creation of **CERTs/CSIRTs** (Computer Emergency Response Teams).

# Internet-Era & Social Engineering Attacks

## LoveLetter / ILOVEYOU Virus (2000)

- Spread through email attachments disguised as a love letter.
- Scanned the victim’s address book and self-replicated.
- Stole passwords and affected 45M+ computers, costing ~$10B.
- Lesson: **first major global social engineering attack** → highlighted human vulnerability.

### What is Social Engineering?

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain access, information, or money.

Attackers use:

- Authority
- Intimidation
- Familiarity
- Trust
- Scarcity
- Urgency

---

# Modern Breach Example: The Equifax Breach (2017)

- Attackers stole PII/SPII from **143+ million people**.
- Caused by **multiple unpatched vulnerabilities**.
- Included SSNs, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, addresses, credit card info.
- Result: over **$575 million** in fines and settlements.

## 🛠 Common Attack Types Today

### 🐟 Phishing

Tricking users into revealing sensitive data or executing malicious software.  
Types include:

- BEC
- Spear phishing
- Whaling
- Smishing
- Vishing

### 🦠 Malware

Software designed to cause harm.  
Examples:

- **Viruses** (user-triggered)
- **Worms** (self-replicating)
- **Ransomware**
- **Spyware**

### 🎭 Social Engineering Attacks

- Social media phishing
- Watering hole attacks
- USB baiting
- Physical impersonation

### 🔑 Password Attacks

- Brute force
- Rainbow table

### 🪤 Supply-Chain Attacks

Compromise occurs through vendors, partners, or software dependencies.

### 🤖 Adversarial AI

Manipulating AI/ML models to make attacks more effective.

# 👥 Threat Actors & Hackers

### **APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)**

- Highly skilled, long-term campaigns
- Target governments, critical infrastructure, intellectual property

### **Insider Threats**

- Employees or contractors who misuse authorised access

### **Hacktivists**

- Motivated by political or social agendas

### **Hackers**

- **Authorised (ethical)** — follow laws, help defend organisations
- **Semi-authorised (researchers)** — find vulnerabilities without exploiting them
- **Unauthorised (malicious)** — steal data for profit, power, or disruption
