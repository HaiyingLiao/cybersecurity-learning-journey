## Module 3 — Security Frameworks, Controls & Risk Management

This module explains how security professionals use frameworks, standards, and controls to continuously identify, manage, and reduce security risk. It also introduces major compliance laws, global regulations, and the ethical responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals.

# What I Learned

### Security frameworks guide organisations in managing risk

Frameworks provide structure for:

- Identifying security goals
- Setting guidelines
- Implementing processes
- Monitoring & communicating results

Frameworks help protect PII/SPII, meet compliance requirements, and align security with business goals.

### Controls reduce specific risks

Security controls are safeguards (policies, processes, tools) used to prevent, detect, or mitigate threats.  
Example: requiring mandatory privacy training to reduce human-error risk.

### The CIA triad underpins all controls

- **Confidentiality:** Only authorised users can access data.
- **Integrity:** Data must remain accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability:** Data must be accessible when needed.

CIA helps organisations evaluate asset risk and choose appropriate controls.

# Security Frameworks & Compliance

### Security Lifecycle

A continuous process of managing risk, creating standards, enforcing policies, and maintaining compliance.

### Core components of frameworks

1. **Identify & document goals** (e.g., GDPR compliance).
2. **Set guidelines** (e.g., how to handle user data requests).
3. **Implement processes** (e.g., verify user identity for profile changes).
4. **Monitor & report** (e.g., detecting a GDPR-related incident).

# Major Frameworks & Standards

## NIST Frameworks

- **NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework):** Guides risk management and incident response.
- **NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework):** Addresses the lifecycle of assessing and authorising systems.

## FERC-NERC (Power Grid Compliance)

For organisations tied to the North American power grid — must follow Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards.

## FedRAMP

Standardises security for U.S. government cloud services.

## CIS Controls

Actionable security controls to defend against known cyber threats.

## GDPR

EU regulation protecting personal data and privacy.  
Key points:

- Must disclose breaches within 72 hours
- Must be transparent about data use
- Heavy fines for non-compliance

## PCI DSS

Global standard for secure handling of credit card data.

## HIPAA / HITRUST

Protects patient health information (PHI).  
Requires privacy, security, and breach notification processes.

## ISO standards

International standards across technology, management, and processes.

## SOC 1 / SOC 2

Reports assessing organisational security, integrity, privacy, and risk management practices.

# Understanding Risk, Assets & Controls

### Assets

Anything of value — e.g., databases containing SSNs, financial data, or customer details.

### Why controls differ by asset

High-value, high-risk assets require stricter controls than public information.

---

# Threat Actors & Their Motivations

- **APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats):** Highly skilled groups targeting governments & corporations.
- **Insider threats:** Employees/contractors misusing access.
- **Hacktivists:** Motivated by political/social causes.
- **Hackers:**
  - **Authorised (ethical)**
  - **Semi-authorised (researchers)**
  - **Unauthorised (malicious)**

Understanding attacker motivations helps organisations prioritise risks.

# Ethics in Cybersecurity

Security professionals must:

- Protect confidentiality and privacy
- Follow laws and regulations
- Remain unbiased and evidence-based
- Act responsibly and transparently
- Continuously maintain their skills

### Counterattacks

- **Illegal in the U.S.** except for federal/military personnel
- Internationally permitted only under strict conditions
- Generally discouraged because it escalates risk

Ethics guide behaviour when dealing with sensitive data and evolving threats.
