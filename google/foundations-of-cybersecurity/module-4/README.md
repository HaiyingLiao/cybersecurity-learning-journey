# Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Cybersecurity Tools & Entry-Level Analyst Toolkit

## This module introduces the essential tools, technologies, and concepts that entry-level analysts encounter.

# What I learned

### Analysts use many tools, each serving a specific purpose

Different organisations use different toolsets depending on their systems and security needs. This module builds foundational awareness of what these tools are—not how to operate them fully.

### SIEM tools are core to monitoring modern environments

They help analysts quickly detect threats by collecting and analysing log data.

### Playbooks support consistent and repeatable workflows

They guide analysts through security tasks such as incident response or digital evidence handling.

### Forensics concepts (like chain of custody & order of volatility) matter

Analysts must understand _why_ evidence must be preserved correctly—even if they don't perform forensic work directly.

### Tools like antivirus, IDS, packet sniffers, encryption, and pen testing form the foundation of cybersecurity practice

Knowing their purpose helps analysts interpret alerts, behaviours, and risks.

# Overview of Tools Introduced

## SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

- Collects log data
- Provides dashboards & alerts
- Helps analysts filter millions of events into what needs attention

Notable points:

- Cloud SIEM is easier for smaller teams
- On-prem SIEM offers more custom control

---

## Packet Sniffers (Network Protocol Analyzers)

Tools that:

- Capture network traffic
- Help identify suspicious patterns or communication
- Support troubleshooting and detection

---

# Playbooks & Forensic Concepts (Introductory Level)

### Playbooks

Documents that outline step-by-step procedures for tasks such as incident response or evidence handling.

### Chain of Custody

A record of:

- Who handled evidence
- When, where, and why

Ensures evidence stays intact and trustworthy.

### Order of Volatility

A principle for preserving the most fragile data first in investigations.

# Additional Tools & Concepts

## Operating Systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)

This module teaches:

- What an operating system is
- That Linux is open-source and widely used in security
- The idea of command-line interfaces

## Web Vulnerabilities

Basic understanding of what a web vulnerability is.  
OWASP Top 10 provides rankings of the most critical risks.

## Antivirus Software

Detects and removes malicious software.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Monitors network traffic and flags suspicious activity.

## Encryption

- What plaintext vs ciphertext is
- Why encryption protects confidentiality

## Penetration Testing

A high-level overview of how pen testing identifies vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
