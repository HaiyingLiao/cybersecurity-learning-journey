## What I learned

### 1. What Cybersecurity Is

Cybersecurity is the practice of ensuring **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorised access or criminal exploitation.

### 2. Why Cybersecurity Is Important

- Strong security protects an organisation’s **reputation** and **ethical standing**.
- A data breach affects more than just a business — it impacts **users, clients, customers, employees, and partners**.
- Cybersecurity has both **legal** and **moral** implications. Organisations are responsible for safeguarding personal information.
- Good security improves **user trust**, which supports business growth and long-term stability.

### 3. Understanding PII and SPII

#### PII — Personally Identifiable Information

Any information used to infer an individual’s identity, including:

- Full name
- Date of birth
- Physical address
- Phone number
- Email address
- IP address
- Other identifying data

#### SPII — Sensitive PII

A stricter category of PII that requires stronger protection, including:

- Social security or national ID numbers
- Financial information
- Medical information
- Biometric data (e.g., facial recognition)

SPII can cause **significant harm** if compromised.

### 4. Data Breaches

When PII or SPII is exposed, it can lead to:

- Identity theft
- Fraud
- Long-term harm to individuals
- Loss of customer trust
- Financial and legal penalties for organisations

### 5. Identity Theft

- Identity theft happens when attackers use stolen personal information to impersonate a victim.
- The main objective is often **financial gain**.
- Protecting PII/SPII is the first line of defence against this threat.
