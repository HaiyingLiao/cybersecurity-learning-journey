# Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Security Domains

## This module provides a deeper introduction to CISSP’s eight security domains. It also explores the relationship between threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, and introduces the seven steps of NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF), which organisations use to manage security risks.

# What I Learned

## CISSP’s Eight Security Domains

I gained a clearer understanding of the structure of cybersecurity work and the areas security professionals focus on. The eight CISSP domains include:

1. **Security and Risk Management** — setting security goals, policies, compliance, and ethical standards.
2. **Asset Security** — classifying, storing, protecting, and disposing of data.
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering** — designing secure systems and understanding vulnerabilities in hardware/software.
4. **Communication and Network Security** — securing data in transit, managing network architecture, and preventing unauthorised access.
5. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** — ensuring the right users have the right access at the right time.
6. **Security Assessment and Testing** — evaluating systems, performing audits, and validating security controls.
7. **Security Operations** — monitoring, incident response, investigations, and operational security tasks.
8. **Software Development Security** — secure coding, SDLC best practices, and managing risks in applications.

This gave me a better picture of how wide the cybersecurity field is and how these domains guide organisational security work.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

- **Threats** — Anything with the potential to cause harm (e.g., attackers, malware, natural disasters).
- **Vulnerabilities** — Weaknesses that could be exploited (e.g., unpatched systems, weak passwords).
- **Risks** — The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

## How These Factors Impact Organisations

Key impacts include:

- Data loss or exposure
- Productivity and operational disruption
- Financial consequences
- Reputational damage
- Legal and compliance issues

This reinforces why structured frameworks and risk management processes are essential.

## NIST RMF — Seven-Step Framework

I became familiar with the purpose and flow of NIST’s Risk Management Framework, which organisations use to manage security risk continuously:

1. **Prepare** — establish context and readiness
2. **Categorise** — classify systems and the data they handle
3. **Select** — choose appropriate security controls
4. **Implement** — apply the selected controls
5. **Assess** — evaluate whether controls are effective
6. **Authorise** — management formally accepts the system’s risk level
7. **Monitor** — continuously track changes, risks, and control performance

The RMF showed me how organisations build, maintain, and validate their security posture.
